In this problem you will upgrade an existing app and you will add multi language support for a console application. This application will provide {\bfseries{Turkish}} and {\bfseries{English}} languages. Sentences on the screen will be stored on files. For example English words or sentences will be stored on {\bfseries{en.\+dat}} and Turkish sentences and words will be stored in {\bfseries{tr.\+dat}}. There will be configuration file {\bfseries{lang.\+dat}} to keep language selection for user. If language is English then {\bfseries{en.\+dat}} file content will be used otherwise {\bfseries{tr.\+dat}} file will be used. You will use the following working example “$\ast$$\ast$\+Department\+Store\+Management\+System$\ast$$\ast$” and one more menu option for language selection such as “\+Change Language” to following list. In the first time and run default will be Turkish language and if there is no selection for first time you will create default {\bfseries{lang.\+dat}} for Turkish, then user can edit language from “$\ast$\+Change Language$\ast$” menu by selection with \uline{arrow keys (up or down) as below}. There is language example that you can use similar features for this homework “$\ast$$\ast$\+Localization\+Example$\ast$$\ast$”.



Your application will have following menu items and actions

\char`\"{}\+Change Language\char`\"{} menu item



Option for Turkish and English selection



Dynamic update after selection



Then you can try again
